# Normally we fetch the CI-built release ZIP rather than compiling: trill is an
# Xcode project with ~15 SwiftPM packages, and macOS 26 refuses to let a
# session-less `_nixbld` user apply SwiftPM's manifest sandbox, so a from-source
# Nix build dies at package resolution (pounce dodges this only by being plain
# `swiftc` with zero packages). The ZIP is already Developer-ID signed + Apple
# notarized, which is exactly what a stable Full Disk Access grant wants — so
# unpack it verbatim and let the rice place it at a fixed path (no re-sign dance).
#
# The one exception is `bench try` feel-testing a source branch: it builds the
# app in your login session (where xcodebuild works) and overrides `prebuilt` to
# that build, so we wrap that .app instead of the release. Same packaging.
